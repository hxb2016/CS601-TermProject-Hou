## URLs of my project resources:

- **GitHub ( Storage address )**: <https://github.com/hxb2016/CS601-TermProject-Hou.git>

- **Project Host (View project)**: <https://hxb2016.github.io/CS601-TermProject-Hou/pages/index.html>

- **Another Project Host (View project)**: <https://gre-test-1-1311699754.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/cs601/CS601_TermProject_Hou/pages/index.html> 

  If the GitHub page host was slow to load, I recommend using this one which I paid for. In my own tests, the second host loaded faster.
